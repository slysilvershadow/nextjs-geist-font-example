    DNA-Based Sprite & Animation System
    DNA SCHEMA OVERVIEW
    Every character is generated using a unique DNA string composed of numeric and binary values. These values define pixel-based appearance, structure, and animation behavior. DNA traits influence body part shape, size, positioning, color, and even movement dynamics.

Technical Details
    | Aspect      | Recommendation                            |
    | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | Canvas Size | 64x128 px (base sprite resolution)        |
    | DNA Input   | Seeded PRNG + DNA string                  |
    | Output      | Pixel arrays or runtime `.png` export     |
    | Storage     | Hash DNA string to filename               |
    | Variation   | Noise/mutation from biome, age, or traits |
ANIMATION SYSTEM
    Modular Animation
    Each body part animates independently with transformations instead of full-frame redraws:
    	Head: 
            Idle bob, turn, blink, speak
	    Arms: 
            Swing, gesture, lift
	    Legs: 
            Walk, jump, crouch
	    Torso: 
            Breathe, sway
	    Tail/Wings: 
            Flick, flap, curl
	    Hair/Eyes: 
            Bounce, blink, glance
DNA-Based Motion
    DNA traits directly influence how parts move:
    | Trait            | Animation Impact                  |
    | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `leg_shape`      | Walk cycle style                  |    
    | `arm_count`      | Multi-limb swing arcs             |
    | `tail_type`      | Curl and wag dynamics             |    
    | `horn_shape`     | Head movement weight              |
    | `body_shape`     | Center of mass, bounce sway       |
    | `wing_type`      | Enables flight animations         |
    | `limb_length`    | Transform range and timing        |
    | Emotional Traits | Changes expressiveness and pacing |
    Store an `animation_profile` per character derived from DNA + mood.
    Frame Options:
        Option 1: Pre-baked Animation
	    Procedurally generate frames on spawn
	    Stored in texture atlases
	    Efficient for low-power systems
    Option 2: Transform-Based (Skeletal Pixel Animation)
	    Each body part is a separate image/layer
	    Use trigonometry or bones to rotate/move parts
	    Ideal for gear overlay and real-time reactions
CORE ANIMATION STATES
     Category     | Examples                                     |
    | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
    | **Idle**     | Blink, breathe, tail flick                   |
    | **Movement** | Walk, run, jump, climb                       |
    | **Combat**   | Attack, defend, cast                         |
    | **Social**   | Talk, sit, hug                               |
    | **Work**     | Mine, craft, haul                            |
    | **Emotion**  | Bounce (joy), slump (fatigue), stomp (anger) |
    | **Sleep**    | Lie down, snore                              |
    | **Death**    | Collapse, dissolve, fossilize                |
    Animations consist of key poses + interpolated frames. Can be baked or runtime-generated.
EXPRESSIVENESS & ADAPTIVITY
    Characters reflect internal states through posture and pacing:
    | State       | Motion Modifier         |
    | ----------- | ----------------------- |
    | High Morale | Bounce, faster gestures |
    | Low Energy  | Slow, drooping limbs    |
    | Anger       | Sharp, stomp-heavy      |
    | Affection   | Open arms, soft sway    |
    | Stealth     | Crouch, smooth steps    |
    Bonus features for depth:
    	Biome posture (e.g., hunch in cold)
