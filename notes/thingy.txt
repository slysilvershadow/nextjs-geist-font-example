# Build a fully modular procedural simulation in Python that:
# ‚úÖ Procedurally generates a world using layered environmental, geographic, and societal systems.
# ‚úÖ Includes modular sprite-based visual rendering of agents, creatures, terrain, and features.
# ‚úÖ Uses Python classes, YAML configuration files, and Enum-controlled vocabularies.
# ‚úÖ Follows a step-by-step world-generation pipeline using provided function names.

# üîß Technologies to use:
# - Python
# - numpy for grid math
# - PIL and Pygame possibly matplotlib for rendering 2D visual output
# - pyyaml for YAML data input
# - enum for structured types

# üî® Implement the following world generation functions in sequence:
def seed()
def arrays()
def mantle()
def plates()
def vectors()
def motion()
def interact()
def subduction()
def uplift()
def elevation()
def ice()
def melt()
def isostasy()
def volcano()
def seafloor()
def wind()
def moisture()
def rivers()
def erosion()
def soil()
def biome()
def resources()
def life()
def climate()
def weather()
def features()
def build()
# Each function should be modular and build on the output of the previous one, culminating in a finalized world state.

# üß± Create classes for all the following simulation entities. Each class must:
# - Define a *_properties dictionary
# - Accept YAML input to initialize state
# - Use Enums for strict attributes (e.g. diet, climate type, stat names)

# üß† Trait Domains
# Traits evolve with age and behavior, across the following domains:
# - Temperament
# - Emotional
# - Social
# - Cognition
# - Interaction
# - Identity
# - Moral
# - Perspective
# - Purpose
# - Ethics
# - Legacy

# üëÅÔ∏è Eye Types
# Shapes: Almond, Round, Monolid, Downturned, Upturned, Hooded
# Spacing: Close-set, Normal-set, Wide-set
# Depth: Deep-set, Normal-set, Protruding

# üßç Body Typing
# Somatotypes: Ectomorph, Mesomorph, Endomorph
# Body Shapes: Pear, Inverted Triangle, Apple, Rectangle, Hourglass

# üé® SPRITE RENDERING & CONSTRUCTION
# Render Order: Tail ‚Üí Back legs ‚Üí Torso ‚Üí Arms ‚Üí Head ‚Üí Face ‚Üí Hair ‚Üí Accessories
# Symmetry default: mirrored, with exceptions
# Shape deformation via DNA parameters
# Color via indexed palettes per character
# Canvas: 64x128px, output to PNG or array

# üéûÔ∏è ANIMATION SYSTEM
# - Modular skeletal animation (transform-based or pre-baked)
# - DNA influences animation profile (e.g. long limbs = slow arcs)
# - Core states: Idle, Movement, Combat, Social, Work, Emotion, Sleep, Death
# - Expressive states: Joy (bounce), Anger (stomp), Fatigue (slump), Affection (sway), Stealth (creep)
# - Features: biome posture, stamina breath rate, mood-based blinking, mutation-driven movement

# üñºÔ∏è Graphics Requirements:
# - Procedurally generate tilemap-style terrain with elevation, moisture, biome, and river overlays.
# - Render the map to an image grid with labeled or color-coded tile types.
# - Each creature must have a modular sprite composed of parts (head, body, limbs, accessories).
# - Attach creature sprite parts to a skeleton rig for idle/animated poses (basic 2D bone system).
# - Display creature sprites on their tile location.
# - Include a legend and/or map key for biome, elevation, water, and creature locations.
# - Output the world map as a PNG or interactive visual window.

# üß∞ Data & Tools
# - Input Format: YAML config files
# - Output: Visual rendering + JSON/YAML save
# - Libraries: numpy, PIL, pygame, pyyaml, enum

# üß† Additional:
# - Use Enums to lock properties like `Mood`, `Diet`, `BiomeType`, `SkillType`, 'Polarity', etc.
# - Include a `build()` function that calls all generation steps and then renders the final simulation.
# - Support saving and reloading world state via YAML or JSON.

# üîÅ Goal:
# - Fully working simulation that loads data from YAML, builds the world step-by-step, populates it with life, and renders it visually with procedurally assembled graphics.
# Generating a full summary of the current document content to help verify completeness
