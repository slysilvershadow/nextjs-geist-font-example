Using the notes provided Create an in depth 2d top down life survival simulation. 
Core Features include:
    Fully simulated AI-driven Characters with emergent autonomy, each one should have its own memories, personality quirks, and daily schedules, without being preprogrammed.
    Characters should have abilities like mining, chopping trees, combat, crafting, eating, exploring, sleeping, having open ended conversations with each other, building and breaking relationships with other characters, building skills, coordinating amongst themselves, going to war, going to work, geting fired, making money, buying products, stealing, being arrested, teaching each other things, dying, and having offspring. 
	Generational gameplay and personality evolution across life stages
	Deterministic, DNA-based genetics system for inheritance and visual sprite generation
	Custom calendar with 10-day weeks and 300-day years
	Deep crafting system spanning natural, mundane, and magical recipes
	Procedural world with evolving ecosystems
	Advanced AI with needs, stats, skills, and social behaviors
	Modular and stat-influenced action system
Please use the notes provided and code the simulation in python make it easy to understand with explainitory comments, the simulation should use pygame, namemaker, networkx,

AI Simulation System:
	All Characters are fully simulated and possess the same abilities as players. 
	There are no hardcoded behaviors or static scripts. 
	The following subsystems govern AI behavior:
		1. Memory & Personality
			Characters store long- and short-term memories of events, relationships, places, and decisions.
			Personality quirks influence how they react to stimuli and others.
			Memories affect decisions (e.g., betrayals, debts, favors, history with locations).
		2. Autonomous Behavior & Scheduling
			Characters manage their own daily routines based on needs, goals, and roles.
			Schedules adapt dynamically to environmental conditions, clan demands, or relationships.
			Priorities include survival, socialization, work, recreation, and rest.
		3. Skills & Progression
			Skills are learned through use and teaching.
			Characters can pass on knowledge to others via mentoring, schools, or apprenticeship.
			Skill decay and generational knowledge loss can occur without active training.
		4. Open-Ended Social Interaction
			Characters hold conversations with the player and with each other.
			Dialogue trees are emergent, context-sensitive, and influenced by personality and memory.
			Gossip systems spread rumors, news, and social influence.
		5. Dynamic Relationships
			Characters form bonds: friends, enemies, lovers, rivals, families.
			Relationships evolve through shared experiences and time.
			Jealousy, loyalty, affection, and hatred emerge based on interactions.
		6. Law, Crime & Justice
			Characters can commit crimes (theft, assault, vandalism, etc.).
			Justice systems exist (clan-based or settlement-based): arrest, trial, punishment.
			Reputation and fear influence whether justice is enforced.
		7. Commerce & Economy
			Characters earn, trade, and spend currency.
			Characters buy products, barter, produce goods, and start businesses.
			Economic status affects lifestyle, access, and opportunities.
		8. Politics, War & Diplomacy
			Characters can form factions and clans can go to war.
			Diplomacy systems allow alliances, betrayal, negotiations.
			Leaders emerge based on popularity, strength, lineage, or manipulation.
		9. Survival & Reproduction
	    	Characters experience aging, illness, and death.
			They pursue romantic partners and can have offspring.
			Inheritance of genetics, traits, and status supports long-term emergent lineage.
		10. World Impact & Legacy
			Character actions persist: they build, destroy, change the world.
			Settlements evolve organically based on Character initiative.
			Tombs, legends, and history form naturally over generations.
